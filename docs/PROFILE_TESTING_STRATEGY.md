# Profile Feature Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Profile feature in the MCP Manager application. The testing covers all aspects of profile functionality including creation, management, MCP associations, data persistence, and user interactions.

## Testing Pyramid

```
         /\
        /E2E\      <- Full user workflows, browser testing
       /------\
      /Integration\   <- Component integration, API testing
     /----------\
    /   Unit     \ <- Individual functions, store operations
   /--------------\
```

## Test Categories

- **Key Test Areas**:
  - Profile CRUD operations with storage layer
  - Profile switching and MCP state management
  - Import/Export workflows
  - Data persistence across sessions
  - Error recovery scenarios
  - Performance with large datasets
  - Concurrent operations handling

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)

#### Profile E2E (`profiles.spec.ts`)
- **Coverage**: Complete user workflows, browser interactions
- **Key Test Areas**:
  - Profile creation from current MCP state
  - Profile management UI interactions
  - Profile switching with visual feedback
  - Export/Import through UI
  - Data persistence across browser sessions
  - Error handling in UI
  - Performance under user load

### 4. Validation Tests (`tests/validation/`)

#### Profile Validation (`profileValidation.test.ts`)
- **Coverage**: Requirements validation, acceptance criteria
- **Key Test Areas**:
  - All functional requirements validation
  - Business rule compliance
  - Data integrity requirements
  - Performance requirements
  - Security requirements
  - Acceptance criteria verification

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Structure

```typescript
// Sample MCP for testing
const mockMCP: MCP = {
  id: 'test-mcp-1',
  name: 'Test MCP',
  type: 'stdio',
  command: 'node test.js',
  args: ['--test'],
  env: { TEST_ENV: 'test' },
  category: 'Testing',
  usageCount: 0,
  tags: ['test'],
  disabled: false,
  lastUsed: new Date()
};

// Sample Profile for testing
const mockProfile: Profile = {
  id: 'test-profile-1',
  name: 'Test Profile',
  description: 'Profile for testing',
  mcpIds: ['test-mcp-1'],
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
  isDefault: false
};
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Profile Creation
1. User has 3 MCPs configured (2 enabled, 1 disabled)
2. User creates profile from current state
3. Profile should contain only enabled MCPs
4. Profile should have unique ID and timestamps

#### Scenario 2: Profile Switching
1. User has 2 profiles with different MCP sets
2. User switches from Profile A to Profile B
3. MCPs should be enabled/disabled according to Profile B
4. Selected profile should update in UI

#### Scenario 3: Profile Export/Import
1. User exports profile to JSON
2. JSON contains profile metadata and associated MCPs
3. User imports profile in new session
4. Profile and MCPs are recreated correctly

#### Scenario 4: Data Persistence
1. User creates profiles and closes browser
2. User reopens application
3. All profiles should be restored
4. Profile-MCP associations should be intact

## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: >90% statement coverage
- **Integration Tests**: >80% feature coverage
- **E2E Tests**: 100% critical path coverage

### Performance Requirements
- Profile creation: <100ms
- Profile switching: <200ms
- Large dataset handling: 1000+ profiles without degradation
- UI responsiveness: <50ms interaction feedback

### Reliability Requirements
- Zero data loss during profile operations
- Graceful degradation under error conditions
- Consistent state after concurrent operations

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Unit Tests - Run on every commit
npm run test:unit

# Integration Tests - Run on PR
npm run test:integration

# E2E Tests - Run on main branch
npm run test:e2e

# All Tests - Run before release
npm run test:all
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Watch mode for active development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Specific test file
npm run test tests/unit/profileStore.test.ts
```

### Cross-Browser Testing
- **Chromium**: Primary testing environment
- **Firefox**: Secondary compatibility
- **WebKit**: Safari compatibility
- **Mobile**: Responsive design validation

## Error Scenarios Testing

### Storage Failures
- LocalStorage unavailable
- Storage quota exceeded
- Data corruption scenarios
- Network failures (future API integration)

### Data Validation
- Invalid profile names (empty, too long, special characters)
- Corrupted JSON imports
- Missing required fields
- Type mismatches

### Concurrency Issues
- Simultaneous profile creation
- Rapid profile switching
- Multiple browser tabs
- Background operations

## Security Testing

### Input Validation
